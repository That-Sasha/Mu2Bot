# Mu2Bot

Mu2Bot is a light weight telegram bot purpose built for furry chat groups, built on [Telethon](https://github.com/LonamiWebs/Telethon).

## Usage
Clone the repo

Set environment variables and volume mapping in docker-compose.yml either by editting the values or providing a .env file.
Run 
```
docker compose up --build -d
```

NB: The build script likely won't work, it's just for personal convenience during development and requires a conda env with the correct name and packages in order to create the requirements file. As requirements.txt is checked in, you don't need to do this.
